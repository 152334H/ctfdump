# Where was he kidnapped? 790 Points - 29 Solves (Cat 3)

```
The missing engineer stores his videos from his phone in his private cloud servers. We managed to get hold of these videos and we will need your help to trace back the route taken he took before going missing and identify where he was potentially kidnapped!
```

We are given a zip file with 3 videos, with each video looking like an **Instagram post** detailing the missing engineer's journey to... somewhere.

We first tried to check `exiftool` for any possible location metadata... but no luck there. There is also no hidden strings or anything of interest.
